# Morse-Code-Translator

by Danijel Boskovic

A morse code translator written in Javascript that takes in input from a text field and translates it from letters to morse code and vice versa.

It works by checking the value of the text field and breaking it up into words and letters, then checking each letter against an alphabet, and replacing it with the equivalent. A couple of test phrases were left in the console log for quick evaluation. 

Known bugs:
* Letters OR morse code work as input, but not both at the same time.
* Characters other than letters and numbers break the program
