# Morse-Code-Translator

by Danijel Boskovic

A morse code translator written in Javascript that takes in input from a text field and translates it from letters to morse code and vice versa.

Known bugs:
* Letters OR morse code work as input, but not both at the same time.
* Characters other than letters and numbers break the program
